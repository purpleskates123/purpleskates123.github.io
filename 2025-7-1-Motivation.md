title: Motivation 
---

One challenge I deeply want to impact in my lifetime is increasing the number of minority kids who pursue careers in technology. I want to inspire them by showing not only that tech is for them, but also the powerful benefits it offers—financial stability, creativity, innovation, and the opportunity to shape the future. 
Growing up, I didn’t see many people who looked like me in the tech space, and that pushed me even more to be the change I wanted to see. My goal is to make sure the next generation doesn’t just see tech as a possibility but as a place where they belong.
When I reach success and I will the first person I’d want to share it with is my grandmother. She has always been the heart of my motivation. Her love, sacrifices, and belief in me keep me going even when things feel hard. Sharing that moment with her would mean everything to me.
To support this mission, I’ve started exploring open source projects that align with my passion. 
One great example is Sugar Labs, an open-source learning platform that brings coding and creativity to children all over the world. Another is Code for America, 
which often supports tech projects focused on equity, education, and community impact. Both projects are actively maintained and community-driven, which makes them strong candidates for me to contribute to as I build my experience. 
Using what I’ve learned so far about open source, I believe I could contribute not only through code but also by helping improve user communication, 
documentation, or even outreach to underrepresented youth.
Technology has the power to change lives and I plan to be a part of that change.
