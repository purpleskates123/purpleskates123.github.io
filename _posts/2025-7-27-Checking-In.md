title: Goals Checking In ðŸª„

In the beginning of my journey with the Catalyst Internship I didn't know what to expect as a junior with limited coding experience. I hoped that I gained connections and new skills from this program; I could never imagine the experience and lifelong memories I recieved while in California. I did say in my previous blog that I would love to learn new skills which Emily, Samir,and Silas all had a part in teaching us I remember my why and realize that I am grateful for this opportunity. Every little opportunity and experience is leading me to greatness and for that everything new I soak up like a sponge. I feel extremely accomplished and I had an amazing summer all thanks to this program. I will continue to practice my new skills as well as try my absolute best to teach others.
