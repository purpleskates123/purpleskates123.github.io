title: First Steps To Contributing
---


Hello Blog! So me and my team are currently working on the OpenSSF Scorecard Community and so far I have retained plenty of information. My team and I have tackled one of the may issues they have to choose from. We worked diligently in lab to rephrase how a code functions in issue #3616. Based on this issue I think the next best thing for my team and I to work on is issue #1534 because it changes the handling dates and copyright headers which is good practice and something similar to what was previously worked on. So far I am looking forward to doing plenty good work and continuing to improving my contributing skills.

P.S Kaylee Williams
