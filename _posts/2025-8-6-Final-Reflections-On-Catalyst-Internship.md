title: Final Reflections on the Catalyst Program ü§≥üèæ
---






Nearly eight weeks ago, I set out on my Catalyst Fellowship with a simple but ambitious goal to grow more confident as a coder and to understand the concepts of open source projects. My main focus was on gaining hands-on experience with the a team and becoming more comfortable working collaboratively on working in codespaces. I wanted to develop not only technical skills like understanding CI workflows and documentation practices but also soft skills like project management, team collaborations, and reading unfamiliar codebases.

Looking back now, I feel proud of the progress I made. I not only contributed to issues and submitted pull requests, but I also became more comfortable diving into open source work that at first felt intimidating. I am proud to say I understand the GitHub flow more deeply, I‚Äôve become confident working across forks, and I can navigate projects like OpenSSF Scorecard and understand how they operate.
The biggest contributor to my growth was the structure and support of the Catalyst program itself. Having regular check-ins, clear goals, and the guidance of mentors provided me with the accountability and encouragement I needed. Also, collaborating with my teammates, helped me realize that no one has all the answers at first, and open source is all about learning together.

If I could go back, I might have asked for even more one-on-one time with Silas , especially during the early stages when I was still getting oriented in the repository. In future open source experiences, I plan to set micro-goals for each week and be more proactive about reaching out when I get stuck. Also asking the maintainers and other contributors for more reputable advice.

Throughout the program, I worked on several issues across the OpenSSF Scorecard project. My team divided tasks to maximize our efficiency, and I often focused on documentation improvements and understanding GitHub Actions.
One interesting challenge was Issue #3684, where our team was testing Scorecard behavior but couldn‚Äôt replicate the output in the documentation. It pushed me to learn more about how GitHub Actions logs outputs and how environmental differences can affect behavior.


The most challenging issue was debugging inconsistencies with Scorecard test outputs. It required a deep dive into GitHub Actions and trying to figure out what might be causing the differences between expected and actual outputs. It was hard to know if we were doing something wrong or if the documentation just needed updating.

I feel as though the most rewarding moment was seeing my pull request get merged after rewording part of the CI-Test documentation. It was a relatively small edit, but it made the documentation more accessible to new users, and it felt great to make a direct impact on a widely used security tool.

The most valuable thing I learned as a Catalyst Fellow is that open source is not about being perfect, it‚Äôs about being persistent. Before this program, I felt hesitant about my coding skills and contributing because I didn't want to be the odd person out. Now, I understand that asking questions, submitting small contributions, and leaving helpful comments are all meaningful ways to participate.

Do I feel prepared to contribute to more open source projects? Yes! I‚Äôve learned how to navigate issues, clone repos, make branches, submit PRs, and even read Go code. I still have a lot to learn especially around writing more code changes


Truthfully I hope to stay involved in open source. I‚Äôd love to continue contributing to OpenSSF and other security-focused projects. My next step is to set aside a few hours each week to work on issues labeled good first issue across different orgs especially the GitHub University and help others focus on the many issues that there are.

I‚Äôd also be interested in learning more with open source but as far as the catalyst program this may be the end of the road for me. I surely enjoyed myself and experiencing some place new was such a great experience but fortunately graduation is coming up soon for me and other obligations have taken up a lot of my time. Futhermore my experience was so cool I learned many new skills and made great connections I am forever grateful.
