title: About Me!
---

My name is Kaylee Williams, and I am from a small town Hammond, Louisiana. I am currently a junior at Southern University A and M College, where I am majoring in computer science with a concentration in Cybersecurity.
Although I'm just beginning my journey into the world of open source, I am excited and more than willing to dive in and learn all that I can. I believe in the power of collaboration, community, and growth-open source embodies those qualities. 
One of the strongest skill sets I bring to any team is effective communication. Whether it's working through a project with teammates or seeking guidance from mentors, I am always eager and engaged. I also pride myself on having a strong will to learn, I typically don't back down from challenges and I constantly push myself to grow. Right now I am focusing on improving my knowledge and practical use of open source tools and platforms. I'm looking forward to the journey ahead and can't wait to connect, learn, and grow with my team!
