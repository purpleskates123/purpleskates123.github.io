title: About Me!
---

My name is Kaylee Williams🙋🏾‍♀️, and I am from a small town Hammond, Louisiana. I am currently a junior at Southern University A and M College, where I am majoring in computer science with a concentration in Cybersecurity.💻My academic journey so far has fueled a deep interest in technology, digital safety, and the evolving world of cybersecurity.

Although I'm just beginning my journey into the world of open source 🌐, I am excited and more than willing to dive🤿 in and learn all that I can. I believe in the power of collaboration, community, and growth-open source embodies those qualities. 🫱🏼‍🫲🏽 I notice open source is a powerful gateway to both personall and professional growth. I am eager to explore new tools, collaborate on projects, and contribute meaningfully to the community.

One of the strongest skill sets I bring to any team is effective communication🗣️. Whether it's working through a project with teammates or seeking guidance from mentors, I am always eager and engaged. I also pride myself on having a strong will to learn,📓 I typically don't back down from challenges and I constantly push myself to grow. I thrive sharing my ideas and asking questions that lead me to better outcomes.

One of my biggest goals is to learn how to effectively use open source for my own benefit. I am willing to step out of my comfort zone and expand my knowledge. Right now I am focusing on improving my knowledge and practical use of open source tools and platforms. I'm looking forward to the journey ahead and can't wait to connect, learn, and grow with my team! 🪄
