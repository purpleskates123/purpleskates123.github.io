title: Greying of Open Source as a Gen Zer 
---

As a new open source contributor, Abby’s explanation of the need for more contributors really resonated with me. It made me realize how important our involvement is, and her words inspired me to dedicate more of my time to contributing. She mentioned that open source could become scarce in the coming years, which was eye-opening.

While I agree with her point that our generation often lacks confidence, I don’t personally feel that way. Still, I understand how getting started with open source can feel overwhelming; it’s rarely simple at first, like many things in life.

As a Gen Zer, I believe there should be a stronger emphasis on open source in computer science education. If more students were aware of it, I think many of my peers would be excited to get involved. Starting a campus organization focused on Git and open source would be a great step forward and could help bring more students into the community.
