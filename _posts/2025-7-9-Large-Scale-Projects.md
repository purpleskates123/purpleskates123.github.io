title: Large Scale Projects
---
This week in lab, I explored a large-scale open-source project called p5.js and I have to say, it was a lot more exciting than I expected. pP5.js is a JavaScript library focused on creative coding, especially for people who might not come from a traditional computer science background. Artists, designers, educators, and beginners can all use it to create interactive web experiences without needing to master every technical detail. The whole project is about making code more approachable and expressive.

A lot of people contribute The GitHub repo shows over 100 contributors, but a core team manages most of the work. There’s a healthy mix of longtime maintainers and newer volunteers, which is always a good sign in open source.

It is very active there are recent commits, ongoing pull requests, and open discussions happening every week. The Issues tab on GitHub is buzzing with bugs, suggestions, and enhancements. There are hundreds of open issues — yes, that sounds like a lot, but many are tagged and actively worked on, so it’s not just a pile of ignored problems.


If I wanted to contribute, I’d start at their GitHub page: github.com/processing/p5.js. The README is super helpful, and there’s a dedicated Contributing guide that walks you through how to install everything and test your changes. It seems pretty beginner-friendly. Downloading and setting everything up would probably take me 30–60 minutes, depending on how familiar I was with Node.js and the command line.

The documentation is thorough from setup instructions to how the code is structured. There are also design documents and plenty of examples on the official site. For communication, developers mostly use GitHub comments and discussions, but there’s also a Slack group and other channels run by the Processing Foundation. It’s clear they care about community and inclusivity.

What impressed me most is how welcoming the project feels. It’s not just about code — it’s about creativity, collaboration, and accessibility. Even someone fairly new to coding can jump in, learn, and actually make an impact. That’s something I haven’t seen in every coding community.

🔍 Comparing Big vs. Small Projects
In my last blog post, I covered a much smaller-scale project. That one was easier to follow, and feels more rewarding. There’s a smaller learning curve for sure. If I had to choose, I’d definitely rather contribute to the OpenSSF project.
