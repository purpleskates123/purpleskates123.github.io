title: Final Reflections on the Catalyst Program
---






Nearly eight weeks ago, I set out on my Catalyst Fellowship with a simple but ambitious goal: to grow more confident as a contributor to open source security projects. My main focus was on gaining hands-on experience with the OpenSSF Scorecard project and becoming more comfortable working collaboratively on GitHub in real-world repositories. I wanted to develop not only technical skills like understanding CI workflows and documentation practices but also soft skills like project management, asynchronous collaboration, and reading unfamiliar codebases.

Looking back now, I feel proud of the progress I made. I not only contributed to issues and submitted pull requests, but I also became more comfortable diving into open source work that at first felt intimidating. I was largely successful in meeting my goal ‚Äî I understand the GitHub flow more deeply, I‚Äôve become confident working across forks, and I can navigate projects like OpenSSF Scorecard and understand how they operate.
The biggest contributor to my growth was the structure and support of the Catalyst program itself. Having regular check-ins, clear goals, and the guidance of a mentor provided me with the accountability and encouragement I needed. Also, collaborating with my teammates ‚Äî especially when issues got confusing or stalled ‚Äî helped me realize that no one has all the answers at first, and open source is all about learning together.

If I could go back, I might have asked for even more one-on-one time with a mentor, especially during the early stages when I was still getting oriented in the repository. In future open source experiences, I plan to set micro-goals for each week and be more proactive about reaching out when I get stuck.

Throughout the program, I worked on several issues across the OpenSSF Scorecard project. My team divided tasks to maximize our efficiency, and I often focused on documentation improvements and understanding GitHub Actions.
One interesting challenge was Issue #3684, where our team was testing Scorecard behavior but couldn‚Äôt replicate the output in the documentation. It pushed me to learn more about how GitHub Actions logs outputs and how environmental differences can affect behavior.


The most challenging issue was debugging inconsistencies with Scorecard test outputs. It required a deep dive into GitHub Actions and trying to figure out what might be causing the differences between expected and actual outputs. It was hard to know if we were doing something wrong or if the documentation just needed updating.

On the flip side, the most rewarding moment was seeing my pull request get merged after rewording part of the CI-Test documentation. It was a relatively small edit, but it made the documentation more accessible to new users, and it felt great to make a direct impact on a widely used security tool.

The most valuable thing I learned as a Catalyst Fellow is that open source is not about being perfect ‚Äî it‚Äôs about being curious and persistent. Before this program, I felt hesitant about contributing because I didn‚Äôt want to ‚Äúbreak‚Äù something. Now, I understand that asking questions, submitting small contributions, and leaving helpful comments are all meaningful ways to participate.

Do I feel prepared to contribute to more open source projects? Yes! I‚Äôve learned how to navigate issues, clone repos, make branches, submit PRs, and even read Go code. I still have a lot to learn ‚Äî especially around writing more complex code changes ‚Äî but I‚Äôm excited, not intimidated.


Truthfully I hope to stay involved in open source. I‚Äôd love to continue contributing to OpenSSF and other security-focused projects. My next step is to set aside a few hours each week to work on issues labeled good first issue across different orgs ‚Äî especially those focused on cybersecurity, civic tech, or AI safety.

I‚Äôd also be interested in giving back to the Catalyst program itself. I‚Äôd be excited to peer-mentor future fellows or even help document suggestions for next year‚Äôs cohort. If given the chance, I‚Äôd love to attend an open source conference or a security-focused meetup to expand my network and meet contributors in person.
